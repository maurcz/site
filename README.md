# Mauricio's Personal Website

This is a website created with Hugo. Here's the [post](https://maurcz.github.io/posts/001-building-a-blog-in-2020/) that explains the creation process.

## List of open sources projects used in this site

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), a free CSS framework
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free) and it's ~2k free icons
- [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather), a font by Google
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/), that probably doesn't need introduction

[This guide](https://www.pakstech.com/blog/create-hugo-theme/) by Janne Kemppainen influenced the architecture of my custom theme.

## Band Recommendation

If you're into metal, give [Khemmis - Hunter](https://open.spotify.com/album/3u16EqmIewkFrJLvGQFVmL?si=z08XXF5CSgmR4ZTBEsQAdw) a try.
